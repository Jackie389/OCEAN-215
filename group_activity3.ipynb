    "Today you’ll work on this exercise in the same group of 3-4 as last week, submitting a single notebook file at the end of the class period. Decide amongst yourselves which member will upload the completed notebook to Gradescope this week. Make sure that everyone takes a turn being the “Uploader”. _You cannot upload the final code two weeks in a row._\n",

    "### Workflow\n",
    "Each question will be timed to ensure that everyone gets to work on at least a part of every question. Group activities are not graded by completeness or correctness, but by effort. We will be breaking down each question in the following order:  \n",
    "1. Independent work \n",
    "2. Group work and discussion on coding question\n",
    "3. Group work and discussion on reflection questions\n",
    "\n",
    "You are welcome and encouraged to communicate with other groups and the teaching team when you feel stuck on a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, we will be grading based best practices in coding. These include: \n",
    "1) Variables are used to store objects\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Code is commented adequately\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Variables are names appropriately\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Code is efficient with minimal unnecessary lines \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Documenting help from outside sources, such as from other groups or online documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) Final notebook fully runs from start to finish. A good way to check this is restarting the kernel and fully running through all the cells to check for any errors."
